User Story 1: Login 

As a user I want to login to Spotify so that playlists can be created and saved based on the movies I select.
  
I will open the app to the login page connected to Spotify and will be asked to log in using my Spotify account information.

After entering and submitting my information, the login will either be successful or unsuccessful (US1.1).

If the login is successful, I will be directed to a new page that confirms access to my Spotify account (US1.2). After confirming this information, I will be directed to the home page of the web app.

I will see the opening page that features a search bar.
