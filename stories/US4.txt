User Story 4: Recommendation

As a user, I want to have an automatically generated playlist based on the popular movies on that (day, week, or month), 
  I want to know what playlist/moview other users like.

- I hope to see the “popular playlist” before I get to select my own movie (probably appears below the “start selecting movies”, 
  or homepage if we have).
  
- For the features on the “popular playlist”, they should be the same as the generated playlist. 
  The only difference is that this playlist is automatically generated as a recommendation. I want it to look fancier like a  
  ranking system, cuz it is a list of popular musics.
  
- If the recommendation fails, it means no one has generated their own playlist in that time period(day, week, or month). 
  In this case, the original spot of the popular playlist will be replaced by an error message “popular playlist is currently empty”.
