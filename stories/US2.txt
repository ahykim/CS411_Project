As a logged-in user I want to able to select movies to generate a playlist.

Given that I'm logged in, I see the opening page and click on the "start selecting movies" button
This moves me to another page, where there is a search bar and an area where my currently selected movies are.
I can type in the title of a movie, click search, and have it appear in the search terms. 
I can select one or more movies from the search terms by clicking on them. 
The selected movies appear on my screen in a separate area from the search terms.
I can click on my selected movies in that separate area to unselect them, once I do this they disappear from the area.
(At any point prior, I can change my search input and search again to have different movies appear in the search terms)
(Selected movies in the selected movies area are saved even when I change my search terms)

I can click on a confirm button in that "selected movies area" to confirm my choices, generating my playlist, and entering another page.
I can click an exit button, to get out of the selection process at any point and return to the opening page on (line 3). My movie selections are now gone.
