# CS 411 Project Ideas

Idea 1: Movie Generator Using User Playlist History from Spotify

  This project would get the user's playlist data/recently listened songs from Spotify and recommend a list of movies for the user.
  
  
  
Idea 2: Music Suggestions based on Movie Preference

  This project would allow the user to select favorite movies, which would be analyzed to generate a playlist on Spotify depending on the type of movie genre, theme, etc.
  

Idea 3: Restaurant Recommendations depending on Local Weather
  
   This project scrapes local weather data, and depending on the weather, our project will make restaurant recommendations within a 15 mile radius.
